### Developer

I am a software developer with experience in JavaScript, the MERN stack, GraphQL, and more. As a recent graduate of the University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Boot Camp, I am excited to continue my programming journey and expand my knowledge by learning new languages and technologies.
